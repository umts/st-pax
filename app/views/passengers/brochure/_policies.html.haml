  %li
    Passengers are allowed to bring two reasonably sized, easily controlled
    packages on board. Large items, such as skis, carriages, bikes, etc. will
    not be permitted on the vans.
  %li
    Vans have a limited number of seat belts, so passengers are only allowed two
    friends per ride as long as they are going to the same destination as the
    passenger.
  %li
    In the unlikely event of an accident, please remain calm. If you are
    injured, please notify the driver immediately. #{t 'department.abbr'} policy
    requires that the driver remain at the scene until the police and a staff
    member have arrived and cleared the scene. We will not be able to bring you
    to your destination until another van can be sent out to continue the ride.
  %li
    Animals are not allowed aboard the vans, with the exception of certified
    service animals.
  %li
    Our lifts are an extremely safe way to board or exit a van, but proper lift
    use requires cooperation between the driver and the passenger.  You should
    board the lift facing away from the van. Please lock your wheels or turn the
    power off to prevent any movement of the chair and hold on to the handles
    while the lift is in motion.
  %li
    As a passenger in #{t 'department.abbr'} vans you are required, by
    Massachusetts State Law: MGL Part 1, Title XIV, Chapter 90, Section 13A, to
    have your seat belt fastened at all times while the vehicle is in motion.
  %li
    Rides to off campus locations, with the exceptions of doctors, pharmacies,
    banks, post offices, and your residence, are not allowed before 5:00 p.m.
  %li
    Rides from an off-campus location to another off-campus location &mdash;
    referred to as &ldquo;off-off&rdquo; rides &mdash; are limited to two per
    week and must be after 5:00 p.m. or on weekends unless they're to essential
    services that are not open during these times.
  %li
    Van service is provided whenever possible during inclement weather. In the
    event of a snow or ice storm, however, we will discourage people from using
    our service unless absolutely necessary. If the University delays or cancels
    classes, #{t 'department.abbr'} will assume all rides are cancelled unless
    you call to reschedule.
  %li
    Alcohol is not permitted on the vans under any circumstances. If you try to
    get on a van with any alcoholic substance, the driver will refuse the ride.
