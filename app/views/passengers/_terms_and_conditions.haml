    Dispatchers are available Monday-Friday, 7am to 5pm, to schedule rides
    for that day and the current week.
  %li
    New schedules for the following week are available every Friday after
    8AM. You can call on Friday morning to set up your rides for the 
    following week.
  %li
    Rides are scheduled in 15 minute blocks. For example; 1:00 PM,
    1:15 PM, 1:30 PM.
  %li
    Rides are first come, first serve. To help ensure that the van will
    arrive on time and that you will get the ride slot you desire, please
    call at least 20 minutes in advance of your desired pick-up time.
  %li
    There is generally one pick up/drop off stop per building; where you
    are dropped off is where you will be picked up with few exceptions.
  %li
    Rides to off-campus locations with the exceptions of the doctor's office,
    pharmacy, bank or post office are not allowed before 5PM.
  %li
    If the driver is late by more than 2 minutes of a scheduled ride,
    please call the dispatcher.
  %li
    If you are more than 5 minutes late, the van will continue onto its
    next ride and your 'no-show' will be logged. If you do not call the
    dispatcher at this point, the rest of your rides for the day will be
    cancelled.
  %li
    Two hour's notice for cancellations is required. Anything less will
    be logged as a 'no-show'.
  %li 
    Four 'no-shows' or eight latenesses in a 30 day period could result
    in a loss of service. Please note that a lateness is only counted
    if you, not the van, is late.
  %li
    You may bring up to 2 friends with you on the ride.
  %li
    Our last ride on weeknights is 8:15PM - so if you need special
    accommodations for exams, email the Supervisors ahead of time
    (at least 2 business days) at stspv@umass.edu to set up the ride.
  %li
    Registrations are only confirmed during business hours.
    When your registration has been confirmed you will receive an email
    at the address listed above, and you may call the dispatcher to
    start scheduling rides. However, you may call the dispatcher at
    (413) 545-2086 as soon as you submit if you would like to start
    scheduling rides right away.
