%h2 Scheduling Rides
%ul 
  %li
    Accessible vans travel on campus and in close proximity to the University,
    we do not travel more than 3 miles from Du Bois Library. 
  %li
    When you call to schedule rides, you will speak to either the Dispatcher 
    (during the weekday) or the Bus Radio Operator (nights and weekends). Keep
    in mind that the Dispatcher is more knowledgeable about the service, so you
    should reserve your more complicated questions for weekdays.
  %li 
    Permanent rides are those which you will need every week for the entire
    semester. You may schedule permanent rides during the first two weeks
    of the semester, and you may update them at any time. If you don’t need
    a permanent ride on a particular day, please call to cancel ahead of time.
  %li
    During Finals Week, all permanent rides for student passengers will end on
    the last day of classes, so if you have permanent rides scheduled that are
    not class related, you will have to call and reschedule (this includes trips
    to and from dining halls, work, etc.). If you are solely a staff or faculty
    member of the University, rides to and from work, and work only, will remain
    scheduled as usual.
  %li
    Following some holidays during the semester, the University will designate
    that a certain day of the week will follow another day’s class schedule.
    On such days, our schedules will be adjusted accordingly. 
  %li
    There is generally one pick-up/drop-off spot per building. If you are unsure
    where the spot is for a building, please ask the dispatcher when you
    schedule the ride. DO NOT ask drivers to drop you off anywhere else. If you
    need special accommodations, please email the AVS Supervisors at
    stspv@umass.edu
  %li
    A no-show is a ride that you miss completely, are more than five minutes
    late for, or that you cancel with less than two hours notice. Passengers
    who accrue four or more no-shows will be suspended from the service for
    one week. If you ‘No-Show’ to a ride and do not call, all of your rides
    will be canceled for the rest of the day.
  %li
    A lateness is a ride for which you are more than 3 minutes late. Passengers
    who are late eight (8) or more times in a thirty day period, may be
    suspended from the service for one week. Van will wait exactly 5 minutes
    before they move on. 
  %li
    If your driver is not there within 3 minutes, call the Dispatcher at 413-545-2086.
